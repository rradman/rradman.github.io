### Quality Control (QC)

**Quality Control (QC)** is a crucial aspect of the software development process that focuses on identifying defects in the software product before it is released to users. It involves the actual testing and inspection activities that ensure the product meets specified quality requirements. Unlike Software Quality Assurance (SQA), which is process-oriented and preventive, QC is product-oriented and corrective.

#### **Components of Quality Control**

**a. Inspection**

- **Definition:** The process of examining software artifacts (like code, design documents, or test cases) to identify defects.
- **Purpose:** Detect defects early in the development process before they escalate into more significant issues.
- **Example:** Reviewing code for adherence to coding standards or checking design documents for completeness.

**b. Testing**

- **Definition:** The process of executing software with the intent to identify defects, bugs, or other issues.
- **Purpose:** Validate that the software performs as expected and meets the requirements.
- **Example:** Running unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.

**c. Defect Management**

- **Definition:** The process of identifying, recording, analyzing, and tracking defects to ensure they are resolved.
- **Purpose:** Ensure that all identified defects are properly managed and corrected before release.
- **Example:** Using a defect tracking system like JIRA to log and manage issues.

**d. Metrics and Reporting**

- **Definition:** Collecting and analyzing data related to defects, testing efforts, and other quality metrics.
- **Purpose:** Provide insights into the quality of the software and identify areas for improvement.
- **Example:** Reporting the number of defects found per testing phase or the defect density.

**e. Reviews and Walkthroughs**

- **Definition:** Formal or informal meetings where team members review software artifacts together to identify issues.
- **Purpose:** Leverage collective knowledge to spot potential problems that might be missed individually.
- **Example:** Conducting peer reviews of code or walkthroughs of use case scenarios.

#### **Types of Testing in Quality Control**

**a. Unit Testing**

- **Focus:** Verifies the functionality of individual components or units of code.
- **Purpose:** Ensure that each unit functions correctly in isolation.

**b. Integration Testing**

- **Focus:** Verifies the interaction between integrated units.
- **Purpose:** Ensure that the units work together as expected.

**c. System Testing**

- **Focus:** Verifies the complete and integrated software system.
- **Purpose:** Validate the end-to-end functionality of the software.

**d. Acceptance Testing**

- **Focus:** Validates the software against user requirements.
- **Purpose:** Ensure the software meets the business needs and is ready for deployment.

**e. Regression Testing**

- **Focus:** Verifies that recent changes haven’t negatively impacted existing functionality.
- **Purpose:** Ensure software stability after updates or bug fixes.

**f. Performance Testing**

- **Focus:** Verifies that the software performs well under expected conditions.
- **Purpose:** Identify performance bottlenecks and ensure scalability.

#### **Quality Control Processes**

**a. Test Planning**

- **Definition:** The process of defining the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of testing activities.
- **Purpose:** Provide a clear roadmap for the testing process, ensuring all aspects of the software are covered.

**b. Test Design**

- **Definition:** The creation of test cases and scenarios based on the software requirements and design.
- **Purpose:** Ensure comprehensive coverage of functionality and requirements in testing.

**c. Test Execution**

- **Definition:** The process of running the test cases and recording the outcomes.
- **Purpose:** Identify defects and measure the software’s quality.

**d. Defect Reporting**

- **Definition:** Documenting any defects found during testing in a clear and detailed manner.
- **Purpose:** Provide developers with the information needed to reproduce and fix defects.

**e. Test Closure**

- **Definition:** The process of completing testing activities, evaluating results, and closing test cycles.
- **Purpose:** Confirm that all planned testing activities have been carried out and that the software is ready for release.
