### Task Tracking in Software Development

#### **Kanban Methodology**

**Kanban** is a visual workflow management method that originated from lean manufacturing. It is designed to help teams visualize their work, manage flow, and continuously improve processes. Kanban is particularly effective for managing work in progress (WIP) and identifying bottlenecks in the development process.

- **Core Principles of Kanban:**
  1. **Visualize the Workflow:** The entire process is visualized on a Kanban board, with tasks represented as cards that move through various stages of completion. Common stages include "To Do," "In Progress," "Review," and "Done."
  2. **Limit Work in Progress (WIP):** Kanban emphasizes limiting the number of tasks in progress to prevent overloading the team and ensure focus on completing tasks.
  3. **Manage Flow:** Teams track the flow of tasks through the workflow, aiming for a smooth and consistent pace. Any delays or bottlenecks are immediately visible.
  4. **Make Process Policies Explicit:** Clear policies for moving tasks between stages help maintain consistency and ensure that everyone on the team understands how the workflow operates.
  5. **Implement Feedback Loops:** Regular reviews and retrospectives allow teams to assess performance, gather feedback, and continuously improve the process.
  6. **Improve Collaboratively, Evolve Experimentally:** Kanban encourages small, incremental changes to processes, with a focus on continuous improvement.

**Kanban Boards:**  
A Kanban board is a visual tool used to implement the Kanban methodology. It consists of columns representing different stages of the workflow and cards representing tasks. The board provides a clear overview of the current status of all tasks and allows teams to manage their work visually.
