### Authentication and Authorization

#### **Authentication**

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It ensures that the entity requesting access is who it claims to be. Common methods and best practices for authentication include:

##### **Authentication Methods**

- **Username and Password**: The most common method where users provide a username and a password. Ensure passwords are stored securely using hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.

  **Example**:

  ```python
  from django.contrib.auth.hashers import make_password, check_password

  # Hashing a password
  hashed_password = make_password('my_password')

  # Checking a password
  is_correct = check_password('my_password', hashed_password)
  ```

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds an additional layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., SMS code, authentication app, biometric). MFA significantly improves security by reducing the risk of compromised credentials.

- **OAuth2**: An open standard for token-based authentication. OAuth2 allows third-party applications to access user data without exposing credentials. It is widely used for providing secure access to APIs.

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications or systems without re-entering credentials. SSO improves user experience and security.

#### **Authorization**

Authorization determines what actions an authenticated user is allowed to perform. It involves controlling access to resources based on user roles, permissions, and policies.

##### **1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- **Define Roles**: Create roles representing different levels of access within the application (e.g., Admin, User, Guest). Assign permissions to these roles to control access to various features and data.

  **Example**:

  ```python
  # Django example using groups and permissions
  from django.contrib.auth.models import Group, Permission

  admin_group, created = Group.objects.get_or_create(name='Admin')
  can_edit_permission = Permission.objects.get(codename='can_edit')
  admin_group.permissions.add(can_edit_permission)
  ```

- **Assign Roles**: Assign roles to users based on their responsibilities. Ensure that users have access only to the resources necessary for their role.

##### **2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**

- **Policies and Attributes**: Use attributes (e.g., user roles, resource types, environmental conditions) to create access control policies. ABAC provides more granular control compared to RBAC.

##### **3. Access Control Lists (ACLs)**

- **Define ACLs**: Create access control lists that specify which users or roles have access to specific resources or actions. ACLs provide fine-grained control over resource access.

##### **4. Secure Resource Access**

- **Validate Access**: Ensure that access checks are performed on both the client and server sides to prevent unauthorized access through direct URL manipulation or API calls.

  **Example**:

  ```python
  from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated, DjangoModelPermissions

  class MyView(APIView):
      permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated, DjangoModelPermissions]
  ```

- **Use Least Privilege Principle**: Grant the minimum level of access necessary for users to perform their tasks. Regularly review and update permissions to reflect changes in user roles and responsibilities.
