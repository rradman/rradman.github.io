### Naming Conventions

#### **General Principles of Naming Conventions**

1. **Clarity and Descriptiveness:**

   Names should clearly describe the purpose or role of the variable, function, or class. Avoid vague or overly generic names like `data`, `temp`, or `foo`.

2. **Consistency:**

   Follow a consistent naming pattern across the entire codebase. Consistency aids readability and makes the code easier to navigate.

3. **Avoid Abbreviations:**

   Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms unless they are widely understood within the team or industry.

4. **Meaningful Names:**

   Names should be meaningful and reflect the intent behind the code. A name should answer the question, "What does this represent or do?"

5. **Avoid Noise Words:**

   Avoid unnecessary words that do not add value or clarity, such as `Manager`, `Helper`, or `Data` unless they provide meaningful context.

6. **Length of Names:**

   Names should be long enough to be descriptive but not overly verbose. Strive for balance between brevity and clarity.

7. **Contextual Naming:**
   Names should provide context when needed, especially in large or complex codebases. Adding prefixes or suffixes can help, but avoid excessive qualification.

#### **Common Naming Conventions**

1. **Variables and Properties:**

   Use **camelCase** for variable and property names.

2. **Constants:**

   Use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants.

3. **Functions and Methods:**

   Use **camelCase** for function and method names. Start with a verb to indicate action.

4. **Classes and Types:**

   Use **PascalCase** for class and type names, with each word capitalized.

5. **Interfaces:**

   Prefix interfaces with an "I" in languages like C# or TypeScript, or use PascalCase in languages that donâ€™t follow this convention.

6. **Namespaces and Modules:**

   Use **PascalCase** for namespaces and modules. Ensure names reflect their content or purpose.

7. **Files and Folders:**

   Use **kebab-case** or **snake_case** for file and folder names, particularly in web projects or where the language does not enforce case sensitivity.

8. **Enums:**
   Use **PascalCase** for enum names and **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for enum values.
