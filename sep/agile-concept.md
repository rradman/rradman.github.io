### Agile Concept

Agile is a set of principles and practices used primarily in software development. It's designed to adapt to changes quickly, deliver value incrementally, and improve continuously.

### Agile Manifesto

## **Agile Methodologies**

Several methodologies and frameworks exist under the Agile umbrella, all adhering to Agile values but with different approaches:

### **Scrum**

- **Structure:** Scrum is a framework that divides work into fixed-length iterations called **sprints**, typically lasting 2–4 weeks. It emphasizes incremental development, with regular reviews and adjustments.
- **Roles:** Scrum defines specific roles:
  - **Product Owner**: Manages the product backlog and prioritizes features.
  - **Scrum Master**: Ensures the Scrum process is followed and removes obstacles.
  - **Development Team**: Cross-functional team members who execute the work.
- **Events**:
  - **Daily Standup**: 15-minute daily meeting to assess progress.
  - **Sprint Planning**: Plan the work for the next sprint.
  - **Sprint Review**: Demonstrate the working product to stakeholders.
  - **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect on what worked and what didn’t, and how to improve.

### **Kanban**

- **Focus on Flow**: Kanban emphasizes visualizing work items and controlling work in progress (WIP). It uses a **Kanban board** where tasks move from “To Do” to “In Progress” to “Done.”
- **WIP Limits**: Teams limit the number of work items allowed in each stage of development to optimize flow.
- **Continuous Delivery**: Unlike Scrum’s fixed sprints, Kanban teams deliver work as soon as it’s ready, leading to continuous delivery.

### **Extreme Programming (XP)**

- **Technical Excellence**: XP focuses on technical practices that promote high-quality code, such as:
  - **Pair Programming**: Two developers write code together.
  - **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before writing code.
  - **Continuous Integration**: Regularly integrating code changes into the main branch to catch integration issues early.

### **Lean Development**

- **Eliminate Waste**: Lean focuses on removing anything that doesn’t add value to the customer.
- **Just-in-Time**: Only build features when needed, reducing unnecessary work.

### **Feature-Driven Development (FDD)**

- **Feature-Centric**: Focuses on delivering features (small pieces of functionality that are valuable to users) rather than entire systems. It’s especially suitable for larger teams.

## **Agile Roles**

Each Agile framework introduces various roles to maintain structure, although the specific roles can vary:

### **Product Owner**

- Defines the product vision and ensures the team works on the highest-priority tasks.
- Manages the product backlog and represents customer interests.

### **Scrum Master**

- Facilitates Scrum processes and protects the team from external distractions.
- Ensures that the Scrum framework is followed.

### **Development Team**

- Cross-functional team members responsible for delivering the product increment.
- Self-organizing, meaning they decide how to accomplish their work.
