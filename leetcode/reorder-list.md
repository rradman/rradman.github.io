### Reorder List

Given a singly linked list `head`, reorder it to alternate the nodes from the first half and the second half of the list.

### Approach

1. **Find the Middle**:
   - Use two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) to find the middle of the linked list.

2. **Reverse the Second Half**:
   - Reverse the second half of the linked list starting from the node after `slow`.

3. **Merge Two Halves**:
   - Merge the first half and the reversed second half by alternating nodes.

### Detailed Steps

- **Initialization**:
  - Check if `head` or `head.next` is `None`, indicating no or only one node, respectively.

- **Find the Middle**:
  - Use two pointers (`slow` moves one step at a time, `fast` moves two steps at a time) to find the middle of the linked list (`slow` will be at the middle node).

- **Reverse the Second Half**:
  - Reverse the linked list starting from `slow.next`. Set `previous` to `None` and iterate through the second half, reversing pointers.

- **Merge Two Halves**:
  - Use two pointers (`first` and `second`) to merge the original first half (`head`) and the reversed second half (`previous`).

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list twice and reverse one half, which is efficient for this problem size.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return
        
        # find the middle
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        # reverse the second half
        previous = None
        current = slow
        while current:
            next_node = current.next
            current.next = previous
            previous = current
            current = next_node
        
        # merge head with previous
        first, second = head, previous
        while second.next:
            temp1, temp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = temp1
            first, second = temp1, temp2
```
